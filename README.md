# Learning-R
Project for learning R

Creating new project to track progress while learning R and GitHub.

The learning plan:
1. Find open dataset of interest
2. Import dataset into RStudio
3. Explore dataset
4. Correct for data discrepancies
5. Visualize data via either Shiny and/or Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com/profile/matthew.hendrickson#!/)

As always, I'm open to suggestions for better use of GitHub as well as ideas, tips, and tricks for learning R.
